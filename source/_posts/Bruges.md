I only had one night in Bruges, and there is no better way to spend that night than staying in a real castle! Castle ten Berghe is just 3.5 miles outside of the central square of Bruges yet it feels like a world away. Tucked behind a wall of trees, you can't any better if you want to really immerse yourself in the medieval city feel.

The castle is run by Caroline and Amaury, and it's been in their family for generations, dating back to the 1300s.

Sit at one of the cafes in the Markt and enjoy a cappuccino and take it all in.
